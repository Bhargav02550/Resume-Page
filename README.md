# Getting Started with Create React App
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abhiramgopi1/portfolio/main/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-04-27%20at%2021.48.14_7be26099.jpg"></img>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!
- See more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

- **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
- If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
